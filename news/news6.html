            <h1>Supreme Court to Consider Recognition of Transgender Individuals in Domestic Violence Cases</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to consider the issue of whether transgender individuals who have undergone sex reassignment surgery to transition to the female gender can be recognised as "aggrieved persons" under the Domestic Violence Act.</p>
            <p>The move comes in response to a special leave petition filed by a husband who is challenging the Bombay High Court's ruling on the matter.</p>
            <p>The Bombay High Court had previously ruled that transgender persons, post-sex reassignment surgery, can be considered "aggrieved persons" under the Domestic Violence Act, thereby granting them the right to seek interim maintenance in domestic violence cases.</p>
            <p>A bench consisting of Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Rajesh Bindal has granted leave and expedited the hearing, scheduling it for the year 2025. The court has also called upon the concerned parties to submit their responses regarding this matter.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, the Bombay High Court dismissed the husband’s petition challenging the applicability of the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 to his wife, who allegedly was a transgender before marriage and had undergone a sex reassignment surgery.</p>
            <p>The husband argues that the respondent does not qualify as an "aggrieved person" under the definition of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005, as the Act's provisions pertain to "women" in domestic relationships.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the petitioner contends that the respondent had explicitly stated in the FIR that the marriage had taken place under transgender customs and procedures. Given this assertion, even if the marriage is assumed to be valid, it cannot be concluded that the respondent, as a transgender individual, is recognised as a woman, eligible for marriage under the Act.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the petitioner argues that the respondent lacks a certificate from a competent authority recognising her gender identity as a 'woman,' which, according to the petitioner, disqualifies her from being treated as a woman under the Domestic Violence Act, 2005.</p>
