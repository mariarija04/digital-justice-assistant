            <h1>Solicitor General Tushar Mehta Defends Electoral Bonds Scheme in Supreme Court</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing before the Supreme Court on Wednesday to defend the government's electoral bonds scheme, stated that a greater share of political contributions going to the ruling party is the norm.</p>
            <p>The government's electoral bonds scheme has faced legal challenges, and the Solicitor General presented the government's perspective before a five-judge Constitution bench, with Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud leading the proceedings.</p>
            <p>During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta referred to a 2018 report by the petitioner, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), to underscore the importance of regulating political donations and the electoral bonds scheme. The report analyzed the funding sources of national and regional parties during the years 2004-05 and 2014-15.</p>
            <p>The Solicitor General expressed his concerns regarding the potential consequences if the scheme were to be revoked. He emphasized that the figures in the ADR report were voluntarily disclosed by political parties and acknowledged that not everything might have been declared. Mehta warned that interfering with the scheme could set back the progress made in this area.</p>
            <p>Addressing arguments made by the petitioner, which claimed that the scheme primarily benefits the ruling parties, Mehta asserted that this trend has been consistent. He stated, "More contributions going to the ruling party is the norm."</p>
            <p>In response to Chief Justice Chandrachud's query about why this was considered the norm, Mehta initially hesitated to speculate. However, the SG then decided to answer the query to assist the court, while clarifying that it was not a response on behalf of the government.</p>
            <p>Mehta suggested that donors contribute based on policies that will benefit them, as they have their own interests at heart.</p>
            <p>"People know their working style, that if this party forms a government, we would be benefited and more comfortable. It's not possible to get into the mind of the donor, but they know they are not doing charity; they are also doing their own business, and their decisions are business-driven," Mehta explained.</p>
            <p>Going further, the Supreme Court raised the possibility that parties themselves might circulate money, given that donors contributing less than Rs 20,000 do not require detailed disclosure. Mehta contended that this was not feasible under the electoral bonds scheme.</p>
            <p>Responding to the concerns about the scheme's transparency and anonymity, Mehta maintained that the scheme is designed for confidentiality, not opaqueness or anonymity. He stressed that the scheme's legality is a matter for the court to consider and warned that removing the element of confidentiality from the scheme could jeopardize it, reverting the country to its 2018 situation.</p>
            <p>He concluded by challenging the petitioners to explain what benefits they anticipate if the country were to revert to its former state.</p>
