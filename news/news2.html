    <h1>Bombay High Court's Suo Motu PIL on Deteriorating AQI in Mumbai</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p>The Bombay High Court has requested the immediate attention of the Maharashtra Advocate General to address the issue of the deteriorating Air Quality Index (AQI) in Mumbai.</p>
            <p>The bench, consisting of Chief Justice DK Upadhyay and Justice Arif Doctor, directed the High Court Registry to initiate the registration of a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL). The court has called for the Advocate General to represent the state government on November 6.</p>
            <p>The bench expressed its decision to take suo motu cognizance of the worsening air quality in Mumbai and surrounding areas, as reported in various newspaper articles. Additionally, the bench appointed advocate Darius Khambata as amicus curiae to assist the court.</p>
            <p>The court acknowledged that it had been reviewing numerous media reports over the past few weeks highlighting the deteriorating AQI and its detrimental impact on the health of individuals, both young and old. These reports indicated that the AQI in Mumbai had ranged from moderate to severe levels over the past 15 to 20 days.</p>
            <p>While acknowledging that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had taken certain steps to reduce air pollution in the city, the bench noted that these efforts had not led to significant improvements in the AQI levels within healthy limits.</p>
            <p>The bench emphasised that no steps had been taken to provide necessary health advisories or raise awareness among citizens to safeguard themselves from the current deleterious AQI levels in Mumbai, indicating the need for immediate attention. Media reports also pointed out that the air quality in Mumbai had been "unhealthy" for several days, with the city ranking 7th among the most polluted cities globally.</p>
